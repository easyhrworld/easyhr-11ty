As a proud Indian I would like to declare that India is on page with the swiftest digitising countries of the world. These nations are as of now witnessing a big-time upsurge with regards to #mobileconnectivity. The spread of internet infrastructural setup pan India under the symbolic [#BharatNet](http://bharatnet.net/) programme, the immense growth in the consumption of data and also the rise of start-ups in the digital evolution space are interlacing with each other to crate fresh ideas, jobs, services and of course increasing the earning power for millions of Indians.

The profit train is driven by the engine of #BharatNet to which our government has disbursed an amount of Rs 20,431 crore. With a plan to connect 2.5 lakh panchayats in various villages with a network of high-speed broadband. As reported by the Press Trust of India mentioned by Economics Times in [_Government disburses Rs 20,431 crore for BharatNet project_](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/government-disburses-rs-20431-crore-for-bharatnet-project/articleshow/70276902.cms). Next in line is the [#DigitalIndia](https://digitizeindia.gov.in/) project launched on July 1st, 2015 by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Aiming to wipe out all the electronic imports from the overseas market by 2020 to make India a superpower in the field of electronics manufacturing.

On the home front it is a ground for enabling schemes by the Government of India such as Make in India, Start-up India, #BharatNet as discussed above and more. Correlatively benefitting the small and medium business sectors to join in and take the path of growth. For instance – each and every payment transaction between the seller and the buyer will be registered on the cloud. Thus, prohibiting any possibility for not so legal unlawful exchange. Protecting the SMBs working on a transparent and fair model. As discussed by Ashok Khatri in [_Here Are Advantages Of #DigitalIndia_](https://wirally.com/advantages-of-digital-india/) for Wirally, a web story portal.

Talking of SMBs the Human Resource department in any company is an irreplaceable unit. Looking at the growth of #DigitalIndia, digitising the unit is the next big evolutionary step. Ingrid Jenkins, Director, Human Resources - Microsoft Australia couldn’t agree more. He says,  “Transformation is underpinned by a digital mindset that is a unique interplay of technology, people, and process, and technology can also be used to vastly improve HR processes for employees and managers, resulting in a snowball effect of positivity and paving the way for even greater digital transformation within a business.” Quotes Abhishek Agarwal in _How digital transformation is revolutionizing the HR functions_ at organisations written for [Your Story](https://yourstory.com/2018/06/digital-transformation-impact-hr).

Going digital and mobile equipped with a cloud software will be a tiny but revolutionary move. Not only to streamline HR management but also saving a lot of precious time and effort of the employees while maintain the process accuracy.

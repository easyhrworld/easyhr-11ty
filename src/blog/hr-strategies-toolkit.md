"Why," you may inquire, "do I need a policies and practices manual or software program for managing my staff?”

Since when is people management a strategic – consideration, needing meticulous planning?

With employees in the driving seat, you need to creatively and “strategically” manage your workplace to be able to develop, communicate and enforce a set of policies and practices that are designed to promote growth at individual and organizational level. Modern day automation tools offer the opportunity to wield more control over your HR strategic planning based on a defensible quantitative process rather than your “gut feeling.”

Since a strategic plan is an important navigational tool, you need to choose your tools with care, involving all key stakeholders and updating your toolkit as often as your business environment changes.

From widespread fears about job loss to super intelligent robots that will eventually destroy humanity, there are many myths and misconceptions about the present and future adoption of automation tools – are they true?

We bust a few such myths.

**Myth# 1**

**HR function can be completely replaced by automation software**

While it’s true that there are different software available for performing different [HR functions](https://www.easyhrworld.com/), namely an applicant tracking system for hiring; DocRead for core policy generation, SimpleX for [Payroll Management](https://www.easyhrworld.com/features/payroll-software-india/), Cornerstone for recording employee performance, at no stage of the software evolutionary cycle, do we foresee complete overthrow of the human bring from the HR value chain.

These pieces of intelligent coding may be immensely useful in taking on some of the mundane tasks, but they simply cannot, ever replace the HR, completely. Human judgment would still be required not just to operate the software but also to decide and select between the various options created by the man-made programming tools.

**Myth# 2**

**Automation can result in job losses**

A [report](https://www.uipath.com/blog/automation-in-2017-and-beyond) (_4 Projections for Automation in 2017 (and Beyond_), 14 February, 2017) published by the McKinsey Global Institute says, “The right level of detail at which to analyze the potential impact of automation is that of individual activities rather than entire occupations…… Given currently demonstrated technologies, very few occupations—less than five percent—are candidates for full automation. However, almost every occupation has partial automation potential.”

This forecast entails that the future of automation lies in man and machine collaboration, and since neither can happen in full isolation, there is no question of automation eating up human jobs. In any case, self-programming or automation can be applied to only a miniscule section of our jobs, which are mostly repetitive or mundane in nature. Out of the box, strategic thinking does not fall in the realm of tasks that can be automated.

**Myth# 3**

**Business process automation is difficult, if not impossible to implement**

Processes that involve brainstorming sessions and a lot of time engagement between IT teams and external consultants may appear almost impossible to automate, but once the processes have been put in place, and are repetitive in nature, can be automated, and often require lower maintenance than borne on employee salaries.

Such business process automation tools can be extremely useful for many small and medium scale businesses. After an initial set-up cost, the annual maintenance charges are pretty affordable in most cases, where the enterprise solution is cloud-based. Maintenance is usually built into the set-up cost, and one doesn’t have to worry about server space, regular updates etc.

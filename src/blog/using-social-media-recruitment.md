## **Coming up with the Perfect Social media recruiting strategy**

_Do you have a social media recruiting strategy in place?_

It is high time you had with one; else you might just be missing on some of the most fantastic job candidates.

Till now you must have used social media for many things…

_To promote your small business_

_To keep in touch with your friends and relatives_

_To establish business connections_

However, you will now have to use this platform to find potential employees for your company, unless you are okay with your competitors snapping them up.

It is the age of Millennials across the world. It is LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook that these Millennials use, to look for jobs. It is on these social media platforms that you will find the largest pool of applicants who are highly qualified and talented.

Here is how you can start [using these social media platforms](http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/recruiting-hiring-advice/acquiring-job-candidates/social-media-recruiting-guidelines.aspx) to hire people:

**_LinkedIn as a Social Media Recruiting Tool_**

You can post jobs that are available in your company and start searching for candidates on LinkedIn. You can either pay per post or buy a couple of job credits at one go. Signing up for LinkedIn Talent Advantage can also be very beneficial.

In case you don’t want to spend money on buying credits or joining the Talent Advantage, there are also a few free resources that you can tap into. You can start building connections with people you know or even join a few groups that are related to your niche. One other way to find candidates is to put up a status message that says you are hiring. For instance, if you have a job available for an IT consultant, your status message would be:

_“Looking for an IT Consultant… Get in touch with me if you wish to apply or know someone who can apply”_

Once you find people, don’t forget to evaluate their LinkedIn Profiles.

_The profile must be complete and should include a picture._

_They should have recommendations from their colleagues, managers or peers_

_They should be members of groups that are relevant to their fields_

Check if you can get any personal referrals through 2nd or 3rd degree connections that you may have with the person in question.

In fact LinkedIn Profile can tell you a lot about the person before you actually call for an interview.

**_Facebook as your Social Media Recruiting Tool_**

You can increase your applicant pool through many easy and affordable ways on Facebook

_There is the Facebook Directory where you can look for groups, users and pages_

_You can even post jobs in the Facebook Marketplace for free_

_You may even create a Facebook Page for your business and use it as your recruitment tool._

_Posting a Facebook Ad is another option you can choose in case you aren’t getting results as expected. Through this tool you will be able to target the perfect audience you may be looking for._

**_Twitter as a Social Media Recruiting Tool_**

You can easily recruit people through Twitter by Tweeting jobs that are available. You can even establish relationships with your clients and job candidates and expand your network on Twitter. Twitter makes it easier to search for anyone you know, by industry, interest, popularity, location or hashtag.

You can make use of hash tags to make your Tweets stand out. A few examples of hash tags include #hiring #jobpost #employment #career etc. You may even make use of multiple hashtags in your Tweet. However, a Tweet cannot be more than 140 characters in length.

You can even target particular audience with the help of companies like adlogic.

Once you find potential candidates you can start evaluating their activity on Twitter.

_Check if there is a healthy balance between their followers and those whom they are following_

_Check out their network and analyze the quality of their tweets_

_See how they respond to or re-tweet others_

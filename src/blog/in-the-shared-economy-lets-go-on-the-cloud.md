Believe it or not, in New Delhi, emerging businesses now have almost 70% of their applications in the #Cloud, and this trend is giving sleepless nights to their competition, [finds out](https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/cloud-computing/43-indian-businesses-fully-implemented-cloud-strategies-survey/62718459) a recent Economic Times survey.

The reason for the huge popularity of #Cloud-based applications among enterprises is not difficult to guess. The most compelling reason for start-ups, of course is cost – with the infrastructure sharing – cost savings can be staggering. And “Given the organization’s average overall IT spend, the saving amounts to an average of close to $500,000 by using #Cloud providers”, confirms the author of a [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2013/02/20/cloud-computing-boosts-next-generation-of-startups-survey-shows/#43264d79103c) article, #_Cloud Computing Boosts Next Generation of Start-ups, Survey Shows._

The next big driver for #Cloud is time saving. With the infrastructure already in place, companies require less time to roll out their products into the market.

Remarking on the benefits of #Cloud Computing, IBM, the Big Daddy of #Cloud Computing that gave the world the buzzline ‘You make it, we’ll protect it’ [declares](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/benefits-of-cloud-computing) on its website, “Developing in the #Cloud, enables users to get their applications to market quickly.” Hardware can crash because of network issues, leading to huge data losses. But when you use remote resources, not only does your data remain protected at a third-party site, you also don’t have to make heavy investments in the purchase of servers and other equipment. The straight advantages of this are both cost and time saving.

With the Modi government’s ambitious digitalisation drive, Sunil Mahale, of Inc42 in his article, _How #Cloud Computing Can Empower India’s Vision of a ‘Digital-First’ Country_, [predicts](https://inc42.com/resources/cloud-computing-digital-first-country/), “Technologies based on mobility, analytics, Internet of things and most importantly, #Cloud are the building blocks for the digital India mission.”  In other words, going forward, #Cloud and #Cloud-based apps are going to be the hottest trends in Digital India.

Furthermore, the uses of #Cloud are not function-specific. Shared resources can come of use in various departments, Finance, Accounting, as well as [Human Resource Department](https://www.easyhrworld.com/). Complete information can be collaborated and stored in the #Cloud. What this implies is that all [HR-related documents](https://www.easyhrworld.com/features/file-document-management/), such as leave and travel records, payroll forms etc. can be managed in the #Cloud in real time. Stored at one place, those are also easily retractable from anywhere, anytime.

In itself, creating data backups is a huge task. With the #Cloud storage technology, the tedious task of taking data backups gets simplified through automation.

In the Knowledge Economy, the HR department has become one of the primary departments in all business organizations. Resourceful and optimum management of the human resource is a crucial factor linked to a company’s productivity and growth. It’s also one of the key aspects to be managed.

The domain is vast as well as has zillions of processes to manage. For instance, if we talk about hiring an employee, the process starts even before a person is taken onboard and continues till he/she eventually quits the organisation and sometimes even after that. Filtering the resumes to find suitable candidates, managing payroll, in-house certification and training, scheduling and task management, reporting, pensions --- an HR department has endless tasks to execute. As such, the department’s tools also have to be smarter, precise and hassle-free. All these tasks can be managed seamlessly in the #Cloud.

What’s more, #Cloud-based application for HR management are not only cheaper than on-premises solutions, they can also be custom-designed software platforms that can integrate easily with other back-office requirements such as accounting, and general management. The best solutions available today as a service (SAS) enable businesses of different scales to utilise-end #Cloud-based HR automation tools to their full advantage.

Further, apart from processes, there are several regulatory requirements to follow. Ensuring compliance is another task that the HR has to manage in any work environment. Cloud-based HR systems excel in this kind of compliance management.

Lastly, #Cloud can play a vital role in engaging employees as well. As, Nick Ismail says in #_Cloud technology for HR: how big companies can benefit,_ appearing in [Information Age](https://www.information-age.com/cloud-technology-hr-big-companies-can-benefit-123466151/),  “Transparency has been identified as one of the most important factors when it comes to employment happiness, and this is exactly what cloud-based HR can help to achieve.”

Thus, you see, there are umpteen benefits in #Cloud, if you are ready to switch. As Steve Jobs, once went on record saying, “I don’t need a hard disk in my computer if I can get to the server faster… carrying around these non-connected computers is byzantine by comparison.”

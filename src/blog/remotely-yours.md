#### Here are a clutch of cool tools that enable you to manage your offshore team

Let's start with a story: Ganesh works in a software development company in Hyderabad, where he has a proven track record of doing out-o-the-box thinking on complex problems and implementing solutions. His manager appreciates this and offers him a senior supervisory role with an offsite team in Silicon Valley, California.

Ganesh is initially ecstatic but later heartbroken. A reclusive nerd, he doesn’t have the social skills to settle down fast in the new work environment. Worse, as an offshore worker on the payrolls of a different company, he is treated as a second citizen in the US.

To complicate matters further, in sharp contrast to a typical American worker, his work style is more collaborative and less individualistic. Although he is the supervisor, at times he feels that the Americans in the team assigned to him make decisions over his head without consulting him, in the process, often settling for sub-optimal options, in his view. Very soon, Ganesh's poor English speaking skills and lack of local networks further alienates him from the core team that he is supposed to manage.

This is a common problem at today’s globalized work places, where everything from people to software, to strategy, innovation to customer services is being outsourced, remotely developed and managed.

Labor laws vary from worksite to worksite (and vastly between developed and developing economies), sometimes irreconcilably, and personal attitudes to work and office politics further cramp up an otherwise good worker’s leadership style and undermine the operations of an offshore team.

One of the biggest challenges that corporates face as they expand is evolving and embracing a geography-neutral model for HR practices that is universal and location-redundant.

Companies operating in foreign countries struggle to understand and comply with different labor laws, work practices and HR norms, along with managing employees remotely, while serving customers and transacting business with suppliers and partners in multiple jurisdictions.

Managing human resources effectively in remote locations requires cultural awareness and the ability to respond quickly to dynamic changes. It also requires emotional intelligence for working in a collaborative workplace, and aligning the human capital with a global HR strategy carefully tailored to deliver business growth. It calls for a fine balance between the common, global structures, models and systems. HR systems and smart technologies are undoubtedly going to play a significant role in creating this kind of a global operations model.

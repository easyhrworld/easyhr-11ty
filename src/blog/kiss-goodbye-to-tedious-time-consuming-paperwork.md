## **Automate your key HR processes**

Hiring an employee with the right skill sets can be a big challenge for a company. Oldâ€“school procedures of recruiting were ill-equipped to efficiently execute this process, leading to costly decisions in bad hires that cost time and money. Manual methods of recruitment in any case seldom work when there is an immediate need to hire candidates.

Automated methods of recruitment, address many of these challenges. In fact, hi- tech process-led tools and applicant tracking systems have made life easier for the HR teams. The process has been made more efficient in terms of tasks such as:

- Posting job openings on job boards and corporate websites
- Screening resumes
- Issuing call letters for interviews to potential candidates via emails or SMS alerts
- Tracking applicants and requisitions
- Ranking resumes
- Handling inputs, pre-screening the questions and tracking responses

The best news is that such systems come with multilingual capabilities. Nearly all large corporations and about half of the mid-size companies in the world make use of such applicant tracking systems. There may be some hiccups along the way and some amount of resistance from your internal staff, but that's a small price to pay for greater efficiency.

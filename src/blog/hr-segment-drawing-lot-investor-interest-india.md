Today, companies across the globe continue to invest huge time and money in automating their HR processes. There are a glut of innovative tech solutions paired with profitable business ventures, and tech-adopters among progressive companies, and thankfully, there are also investors interested in owning a piece of this action pie.

Right from investing in applicant tracking systems (ATS) to social recruiting tools and other out-of-the-box recruitment, retention and people management software – organizations are on a spree to leverage the power of technology in the course of recruitment, retention, performance management and reward.

In the interim, the overall hiring process has undergone a sea change. With India accepted as the happening hub for all kind of startups, technology adoption and application in HR has gone up to a considerable extent.

Evidently, investors attracted to HR tech are showing deep faith in ‘start-up solutions’. One segment that is drawing a lot of interest is the ‘Software as a Service’ market, where tech-driven HR ecosystem is beginning to take shape.

Notably, [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), a recruitment tech start-up received a “strategic investment” of $7.5 million from [Recruit Holdings](http://www.recruit-rgf.com/). Other HR tech start-ups like [Belong](https://belong.co/), [Hiree](https://hiree.com/), [GrownOut](https://www.grownout.com/), [PiQube](http://www.piqube.com/home/) and [Jombay](https://products.jombay.com/) have also reported significant fund inflow into their innovative products and services.

Belong raised $5 million in Series A funding led by [Matrix Partners India](http://www.matrixpartners.in/) and [Blume Ventures](http://www.ventureintelligence.com/landing1.htm), while [Hiree](https://hiree.com/) raised $3 million from [IDG Ventures](http://www.idgvcindia.com/). Referral hiring analytics platform [GrownOut](https://www.grownout.com/) raised undisclosed funding from Outbox Ventures and Matrix Partners while hiring intelligence tool [PiQube](http://www.piqube.com/home/) raised funding of $500,000 from [The HR Fund](http://www.thehrfund.com/), according to the [People Matters’s post](https://www.peoplematters.in/article/hr-insights/tech-hr-start-ups-investors-radar-11895?utm_source=peoplematters&utm_medium=interstitial&utm_campaign=learnings-of-the-day).

Likewise, [Jombay](https://products.jombay.com/), an online psychometric assessment and talent analytics platform, got funded from [Nirvana Ventures](http://www.ventureintelligence.com/landing1.htm).

We can’t be sure when this bubble might burst, but at least for now at least, these HR techies are laughing all the way to the bank.

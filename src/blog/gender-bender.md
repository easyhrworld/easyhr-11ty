## **The sure-shot way to increase your women headcount**

Many women find it difficult to cope up with work once they have children. When Google saw this mass exodus happening in their company, a couple of years ago, they got alert.

They were smart enough to realize that, believe it or not, this skewed male-female ratio had strangely also begun to impact their bottom line.  That's when Google went all out to woo its women employees back into their fold.

Studies suggest that the [women employees boost productivity](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/more-women-workers-can-boost-growth-imf-chief/article7622559.ece) in every organization.

- If you assume a situation where the number of women employees is almost equal to the number of males, the GDP of US would increase by 5%, Japan’s by 9% and India’s by 27%!
- 51% of women have stated that it is very difficult to move up the career ladder once they have children and 16% of the fathers agree.
- 42% of working mothers decreased the number of their working hours to care for their children and home and 28% fathers did the same.

Yet, the situation is far from rosy. Although its most often a desk-bound role, only 25% of IT positions are held by women. This is also reflected in college enrollments. The number of women students opting for a Computer Science course stands [miserably at 14%](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/we-need-more-women-in-tech-the-data-prove-it/280964/).

Blue chip companies such as Apple and IBM have already started addressing this issue. They are devising special flex packages while giving them the option of working remotely.

**Maternity issues**

Recently, [**Flipkart**](flipkart.com), India's biggest e-commerce company started offering a 24-week extension of maternity leave, along with the option of flexible timing for the next four months with full pay. They also allow a career break of one year without pay, and other [benefits](http://www.livemint.com/Companies/jUkxbv3NapV2E2pDBOHCqL/Flipkart-joins-other-tech-firms-in-rolling-out-maternity-ben.html), such as transport reimbursement, maternity tie-ups with hospital, parenting counseling, child care support and insurance benefits for all employees.

Hindustan Unilever offers five-year career breaks and part-time work policies to retain women employees and recruit more.

[**Dabur**](dabur.com) allowed its women to take extended maternity leave of 90 days.

The opportunities seem very appealing especially women who are on the look-out for building a career without compromising on their home responsibilities. If your organization would like to offer such opportunities, we can help you implement and track your programme's progress.
